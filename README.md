# HiAstro Business Dashboard

Static dashboard for Monetization, Acquisition, Retention, and Engagement.

## Refresh data

Run from `/Users/yashs/Documents/WorkDirectory`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python hiastro-business-dashboard/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py
```

The script reads credentials from the parent `.env` file and writes aggregated data to:

```text
hiastro-business-dashboard/data/dashboard_data.json
```

## Local preview

```bash
cd /Users/yashs/Documents/WorkDirectory/hiastro-business-dashboard
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

## GitHub Pages

This folder is ready to push as a static GitHub Pages site. Do not commit credentials; the dashboard only includes aggregated JSON.
